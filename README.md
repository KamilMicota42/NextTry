<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Project created in order to learn new technologies: Django, Bootstrap, SQLite, JavaScript. The idea of project is close to my heart: eco-friendly, cheap and fun - second hand clothing.

## Functionality Of The Project:

### Looking Through Items
Items are added by admin user in conventional Django admin page. User can scroll through items and view details about them.
Details will diverge from one another because of item category e.g. if the item belongs to category 'shoes' it will show shoe size instead of clothing size.

<br />


### Registration
Every user can register into website in order to access functionality like adding items to cart or to favorite items. Registration form is secured with simple captcha test.

<br />

Registration process takes few seconds this is due to sending welcoming email message. Email is sent by 'company' email account with information about user, like in this example his name wich is collected from db.

### Buying Item
Finally authenticated users can go to checkout page in which they fill the form about address details. After filling the form they get option to 'make payment' which would show their payment options if it wouldnt be for only a project.
