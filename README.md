## About The Project

Project created in order to learn new technologies: Django, Bootstrap, SQLite, JavaScript. The idea of project is close to my heart: eco-friendly, cheap and fun - second hand clothing.

## Functionality Of The Project:

* looking through items
* registration (with the captcha test)
* sending welcoming email to user
* signing in
* viewing items details page
* search for item with its name or category
* adding and deleting items from user favorites and cart
* finally buying item after filling in form
